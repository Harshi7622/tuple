# Get the tuple elements from the user in a single line
elements = input("Enter the tuple elements separated by space: ")
my_tuple = tuple(map(int, elements.split()))

# Initialize a variable to store the sum
total_sum = 0

# Calculate the sum without using the sum() method
for num in my_tuple:
    total_sum += num

# Print the total sum
print(total_sum)
